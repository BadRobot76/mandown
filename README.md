## What is mandown

Need to lookup things from README? Or from manual page? Or perhaps just want to install something cool...

## Install

Current version is incomplete. However, it should work on Linux with newer ncurses(w) release.

Download & install:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Titor8115/mandown.git
$ cd mandown
$ make
```

Usage:

```
$ mandown README.md
```

It should be running for 10 seconds and quit.
